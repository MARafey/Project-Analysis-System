A comprehensive React-based application featuring **two powerful systems in one platform**:

1. **FYP Analysis System** - Domain categorization, similarity analysis, and AI-powered insights
2. **Panel Creation System** - Constraint-based evaluation panel allocation with instructor-project management

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç FYP Analysis System

- **Domain Categorization**: Automatically categorize projects across 15+ technical domains
- **Similarity Detection**: Advanced TF-IDF analysis to find similar projects
- **AI Enhancement**: Optional Gemini AI integration for intelligent categorization
- **Multi-format Support**: Supports Excel (.xlsx, .xls) and CSV files

### üèõÔ∏è Panel Creation System

- **Constraint-Based Allocation**: Hard and soft constraint management for panel creation
- **Text File Input**: Simple instructor-project mapping format
- **Overlap Detection**: Automatic detection of overlapping projects and supervisors
- **Optimized Assignment**: Intelligent instructor assignment based on project count
- **Multi-sheet Reports**: Comprehensive Excel output with allocation details

#### How Panel Creation Works

The panel creation system uses a sophisticated **constraint-based allocation algorithm** that ensures fair and balanced distribution of projects and instructors across evaluation panels. Here's how it works:

##### 1. **Data Processing & Group Formation**

- **Input Format**: Text file with instructor names (one per line)
- **Excel Integration**: Automatically extracts project supervision data from uploaded Excel files
- **Smart Grouping**: Identifies overlapping projects and supervisors to form logical groups
- **Similarity Detection**: Uses FYP analysis results to detect similar projects that should be evaluated together

##### 2. **Constraint Management**

- **Hard Constraints** (Always enforced):
  - Number of panels to create
  - Maximum instructors per panel
- **Soft Constraints** (Preferred but can be exceeded):
  - Desired projects per panel (for balanced workload)

##### 3. **Allocation Strategy**

The algorithm follows a **balanced distribution strategy**:

1. **Fill All Panels to Minimum Capacity First**

   - Ensures no panel is left empty while others are overloaded
   - Maintains equal project distribution across panels

2. **Prioritize Overlapping Groups**

   - Groups with shared supervisors or similar projects are allocated together
   - Prevents conflicts and ensures logical evaluation groupings

3. **Load Balancing**

   - Distributes projects evenly across panels
   - Monitors project count balance in real-time
   - Prefers allocations that result in more balanced distribution

4. **Instructor Assignment Optimization**
   - Assigns supervisors to panels where they have the most projects
   - Distributes non-supervisor instructors to fill panel capacity
   - Maintains balanced instructor counts across panels

##### 4. **Algorithm Features**

- **Real-time Balance Monitoring**: Tracks project and instructor distribution after each allocation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically handles overlapping supervisors and projects
- **Quality Metrics**: Provides detailed analysis of allocation balance and constraint satisfaction
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles edge cases and constraint violations

##### 5. **Output & Analysis**

- **Comprehensive Reports**: Multiple Excel sheets with detailed allocation information
- **Balance Analysis**: Project and instructor distribution metrics
- **Constraint Analysis**: Hard and soft constraint satisfaction reports
- **Allocation Log**: Step-by-step allocation decisions and reasoning

#### **Quality Metrics & Assessment**

The system provides comprehensive quality assessment for your panel allocation:

##### **Project Balance Quality**

- **Excellent**: Panel spread ‚â§ 2 projects
- **Good**: Panel spread ‚â§ 5 projects
- **Moderate**: Panel spread ‚â§ 8 projects
- **Needs Review**: Panel spread > 8 projects

##### **Instructor Balance Quality**

- **Perfect**: All panels have exactly the same instructor count
- **Good**: Panel spread ‚â§ 1 instructor
- **Moderate**: Panel spread ‚â§ 2 instructors
- **Needs Review**: Panel spread > 2 instructors

##### **Constraint Satisfaction**

- **Hard Constraints**: Always 100% satisfied
- **Soft Constraints**: Optimized with detailed violation reporting
- **Overall Success**: Based on allocation success rate and balance quality

#### Input Format Examples

**Simple Instructor List:**

```
Dr. John Smith
Prof. Jane Doe
Ms. Alice Wilson
Mr. Bob Johnson
```

**With Project Mappings (Alternative format):**

```
Dr. John Smith: Web Security Platform, Data Analytics Dashboard
Prof. Jane Doe: Machine Learning System, IoT Sensor Network
Ms. Alice Wilson: Blockchain Voting System
```

The system automatically:

- Detects instructor titles (Dr, Prof, Mr, Ms, Mrs)
- Extracts project supervision data from Excel files
- Forms logical groups based on overlaps
- Applies the allocation algorithm
- Generates balanced panel assignments

#### Constraint Configuration

**Hard Constraints:**

- **Number of Panels**: Total evaluation panels to create
- **Instructors per Panel**: Maximum instructors allowed in each panel

**Soft Constraints:**

- **Projects per Panel**: Target number of projects per panel (can be exceeded if necessary)

The system ensures **hard constraints are always satisfied** while optimizing for **soft constraint satisfaction** and **balanced distribution**.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**:

- Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be v14+)

**File Upload Issues**:

- **FYP Analysis**: Ensure file has proper headers (Project Title, Project Scope)
- **Panel Creation**: Use correct text format: `Instructor: Project1, Project2`
- Check file format (.xlsx, .xls, .csv for FYP; .txt for panels)
- Verify file size (< 10MB recommended)

**Panel Creation Format Issues**:

- **Error**: "instructor names without projects"
- **Solution**: Use the format helper to download template or convert your list
- **Quick Fix**: Add placeholder projects like "Project 1A, Project 1B"

**AI Integration Issues**:

- Verify Gemini API key is correct
- Check internet connection
- Monitor browser console for error messages

### Performance Tips

- For large datasets (>100 projects), allow extra processing time
- Use AI enhancement sparingly for faster processing
- Close other browser tabs during analysis for optimal performance
- Panel creation works best with <50 instructors for optimal constraint satisfaction

### Panel Creation Best Practices

#### **Optimal Instructor Counts**

- **Small Scale**: 10-20 instructors ‚Üí 2-3 panels
- **Medium Scale**: 20-40 instructors ‚Üí 3-5 panels
- **Large Scale**: 40+ instructors ‚Üí 5+ panels

#### **Constraint Guidelines**

- **Instructors per Panel**: 3-5 instructors (optimal balance)
- **Projects per Panel**: 8-15 projects (manageable workload)
- **Panel Count**: Aim for panels with similar project counts

#### **Data Preparation Tips**

- Ensure instructor names match exactly between text file and Excel data
- Use consistent naming conventions (Dr., Prof., Mr., Ms.)
- Include all project supervisors in the instructor list
- Verify Excel file has proper column headers (Project Title, Supervisor)

#### **Common Allocation Patterns**

- **Overlapping Supervisors**: Automatically grouped together
- **Similar Projects**: AI-detected similarities influence grouping
- **Domain Clustering**: System prevents too many similar projects in one panel
- **Load Balancing**: Projects distributed evenly across panels
